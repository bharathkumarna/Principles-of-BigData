# Twitter Data Analysis Using Apache Spark

Description - 

* Developed a system to store, analyze, and visualize a social network’s (e.g. Twitter’s) data. 
* Tweets are collected using Tweepy library and stored in Apache Hadoop HDFS.
* Ran Spark DataFrames and RDDs queries in Apache Spark to analyze the twitter data based on users choice: Top Users tweeted the most, Users with most sensitive tweet numbers, Top Hashtags from the twitter data, Cities from which most tweets posted and Most popular time zones.
* Query results are stored as individual collections in MongoDB using Mongo Spark Connector.
* Used mLab Data API to retrieve the results from MongoDB and visualized them as charts(Line, Pie, Bar, and Histogram) using Google Charts.
